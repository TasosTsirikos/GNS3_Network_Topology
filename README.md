# GNS3_Network_Topology
GNS3 network with 3 routers, switches, and 6 PCs.

# Network Topology
The network topology is designed using GNS3, a network simulation platform. It consists of the following components:

Routers: There are three routers labeled R1, R2, and R3. These routers are interconnected to form a triangular shape network. They are configured with appropriate IP addresses, routing protocols, and other necessary configurations.

Switches: Each router is connected to a switch. The switches provide connectivity between the routers and the PCs. There are a total of three switches labeled SW1, SW2, and SW3.

PCs: There are two PCs connected to each switch, resulting in a total of six PCs. They are labeled PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4, PC5, and PC6. The PCs can communicate with each other within their respective switch and can reach PCs connected to other switches through the routers.
